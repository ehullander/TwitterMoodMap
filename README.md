# Twitterstream
#"Hello, America, How are ya?""
An attempt is made to map the mood of the lower 48.  Using the Twitter API, a random sample of 50,000k twitter tweets are 
collected daily.  The mood of each tweet is estimated using the <a href="https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials/blob/master/assignment1/AFINN-README.txt">AFINN-111.txt</a> dictionary.  Much of this project builds on a 
course project offered through by Bill Howe of the University of Washington through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci">Coursera</a>.
My contribution is in figuring out how to get the data on a map.
