# MoodMap from Twitterstream
#"Good morning, America, How are ya?""

An attempt is made to make a <a href="https://github.com/ehullander/Twitterstream">MoodMap</a> of the United States from a random daily sample of twitter tweets.  The mood of each tweet is estimated using the <a href="https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials/blob/master/assignment1/AFINN-README.txt">AFINN-111.txt</a> dictionary.  Much of this project builds on a 
course project offered through by Bill Howe of the University of Washington through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci">Coursera</a>.
My contribution is in figuring out how to get the data on a map.
